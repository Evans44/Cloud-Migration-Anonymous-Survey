# Cloud Migration Strategy for Anonymous Survey Application

## Overview
This project focuses on migrating an anonymous survey application from an on-premises environment to AWS Cloud to improve scalability, security, and cost-efficiency.

## Problem Statement
The existing infrastructure lacked scalability and was prone to performance bottlenecks, high maintenance costs, and security vulnerabilities.

## Solution Design
- *Compute:* Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Group behind an Application Load Balancer
- *Database:* Amazon RDS (MySQL) with Multi-AZ deployments for high availability
- *Storage:* Amazon S3 for static content and backups
- *Networking:* VPC with public/private subnets, NAT Gateway
- *Security:* IAM roles, Security Groups, AWS Shield for DDoS protection
- *Monitoring:* AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and alerts
